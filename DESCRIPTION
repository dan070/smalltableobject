Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Dan",
           family = "Gustafsson",

Description: Use a sql-database table as if a local data frame. 
    Table should be small-ish, as it will be downloaded to memory.
    Reading and writing the local dataframe is done as usual with [,]<-.
    When local dataframe changes, the entire data frame will be
    written to the data base. Column based hashing ensures that the local
    and remote tables are in sync at each step.
